ScreamCipher is a program that can be used to encrypt plaintext using the Scream Cipher described by [[XKCD-3054]](https://xkcd.com/3054/).

## Use
1. Run the compiled exe-file.

*Note: Only characters in the English alphabet are supported.*

*Example: C:\Users\JaneDoe\Desktop\ScreamCipher\20250224T220308Z-encrypted.txt*
4. Open the file using a program suitable for odd diacritics.  
*Suggestion: Use [Notepad++](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus) set to [use the 'DejaVu Sans Mono' font](https://superuser.com/a/198948/413147).*
